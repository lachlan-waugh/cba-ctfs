## Request Bin
* Check it out [here](https://requestbin.com/)
* There's two different options (see below)
    * Public bin: a pretty basic one which just serves a webpage
    * Private bin: allows for more customisation (e.g. custom responses, triggering a script on request, etc)

### Which to use
* If you're just doing basic XSS, where you're just capturing a request (e.g. <URL>+document.cookie), just go with a public bin
* If you want to do more with the bin (e.g. above), the private bins have way more depth (but are also harder to configure/use)
